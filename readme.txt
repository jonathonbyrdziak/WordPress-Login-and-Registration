Place the fully functional WordPress login or registration form anywhere on your website using a widget, or a shortcode.


== Description ==

With this login and registration plugin you have the ability to drop the following forms right into any page, post or custom listing type on your website.

* Login Form
* Logout Page
* Registration Form
* Reset Password Form
* Password reset confirmation
* Retrieve Password Form

Using the shortcode will allow you to theme your login and regsitration pages exactly how you intend, without the limitations of theming them in their default location.

<h4>No more wp-login.php</h4>
You no longer have to open up your WordPress installation to possible hacking attempts by revealing to your users the default `wp-login.php` url. You may redirect the user from the standard `wp-login.php` url to any url that you would like. This plugin automatically does that with the check of a box.

<h4>It creates a new menu location</h4>
After the user has logged in, you have the ability to specify what will be displayed in the place of the login form. In this case you may select the configuration which displays a navigation menu to the logged in users, instead of a login form.

Simply navigate to the WordPress Menus administration and create your new users only custom menu.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install and activate the plugin to get it working.

After activating this plugin you may access the plugin settings from two locations. Navigate to your widgets area and drag the Login and Registration Form Widget into any sidebar location that you would like. The settings for this instance will display for you.

When editing any page, post or custom listing type you will see a new button added to your WYSIWYG editor, simply click this button and a popup will display with the settings for a new Login and Registration Form instance.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I embed the Login and Registration Form in a page or post? =

Yes. We've built in a WYSIWYG button for you that creates the shortcode. Simply navigate to the Page, Post or CLT that you would like your form to show on, then click the form icon that's provided for you.

= Is the plugin compatible with the default login? =

Yes. The plugin does not depend on the default login screen at all. It actually encapsulates the current login page into a single php class which is incredibly stable!

= Can I redirect users from the default wp-login.php page? =

Yes and No. Users that access the wp-login.php page directly will be able to view it. However, all links on your website can be redirected to any form instance that you specify.
